\section{Investigation of Chlorophyll}

\subsection{Goals and Approaches}
The overarching goal of this portion of the project is to understand what variables help explain the variation of chlorophyll over time and at each station. We want to understand if these relationships differ over time and/or over space. My approach was to first see which other variables that we have information on at the same times and places as chlorophyll are correlated with chlorophyll. I included these variables in what I refer to as the ``parsimonious" model. I then added to a "full" model additional variables that were identified by David as variables whose relationships with chlorophyll, in context, would be interesting to understand. I build models including these variables separately for each station. Then I experimented with truly spatial models by using the station ID as a factor in a model, so I could fit one model and be able to predict chlorophyll for each station at once. After this I went back to make more ``bare bones" models per station that only incorporate the date (to incorporate trends over time) and the day of year (to incorporate seasonal trends) as well as the interaction between the two, allowing these trends to change depending on the value of the other one in order to have more fair comparisons between the various models. I then moved towards models that incorporate a sense of ``flow" using chlorophyll values from neighboring stations and measures of true flow throughout the area. 

Throughout all of these models, I fitted the models in a nested way so that we could see how much each variable contributed to the overall fitted value. I created a Shiny application (a web application written in R) to be able to compare and contrast the fitted values from each model, the contributions of each variable to the fitted values in each model, the overall RMSE per station of each model plotted on a map, and the contribution of volumetric flow averaged yearly and averaged monthly for each station.

\subsection{Details About the Setup}
I chose to use a log link function in each Generalized Additive Model since the distribution of chlorophyll is highly skewed right. I was deciding between log transforming the response and fitting a linear model ($log(y)=X\beta)+\epsilon$) versus using a Generalized Linear Model using a log link function ($log(y+\epsilon)= X\beta$) The residuals versus fitted values plots all look reasonable for constant variance under the GAM approach, so it did not seem necessary to use the log transform which would affect the variance as well as the linearity. We also don't have to deal with the back-transform bias where the back transform of the mean of the response on a log scale is not equivalent to the mean of the response on the raw scale.

I also had to choose which stations to focus on. I decided to pick stations that had records throughout the widest range of dates (from 1975-2015). These stations 15 stations (out of 41) are: C10, C3, D10, D12, D19, D22, D26, D28A, D4, D41, D6, D7, D8, MD10, and P8. This narrowed down the number of stations to a reasonable number (since I was often fitting a model per station) while still representing a wide spatial range. For a few of these stations, there was sufficient missingness in some of the variables of interest that I just decided to remove that variable from that particular model for that station. For full spatial models, I only used variables that were available across all of the stations.


\subsection{Parsimonious Model}

The parsimonious model used variables that visually looked correlated with chlorophyll overall along with temporal components. The day of year was included to account for any seasonality and was fit with a cyclic spline so that the ends match up from year to year. The date was included to account for any trends over time. The non-time covariates that were looked correlated were pheo (pheophytin a), tn (total nitrogen), and do.per (dissolved oxygen per ?). Note that do.per was more highly correlated than do (dissolved oxygen), but I'm not sure what the ``per" means. If in context, the ``per" variable doesn't make sense, it can be replaced with ordinary dissolved oxygen. All but day of year were fit with thin plate regression splines. These splines have some optimality properties, are low rank (needing to fit many fewer coefficients), and isotropic (rotation of the covariate coordinate system will not change the smoothing). The same model form was fit for each station. The maximum basis dimensions per variable change per station to allow for extra flexibility if need be and subject to the constraints of the data at each station.

\subsection{Full Model}

The full model included everything in the parsimonious model and then added some extra variables that are interesting in context but did not look particularly predictive of chlorophyll in pairwise scatterplots. The additional variables that were added are: sio2 (silica), tp (total phosphorus), tss (total suspended solids), nh4 (ammonia), sal (salinity). Again, all of these were fit with thin plate regression splines, the same model form was fit for each station, and the maximum basis dimensions per variable change per station.  Salinity, ammonia, and total nitrogen are the variables that have the most missingness and therefore don't occur in every station's model.
