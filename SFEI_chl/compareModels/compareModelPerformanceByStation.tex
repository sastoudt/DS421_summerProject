\section{Observations by Station}

\begin{itemize}

\item C10: bad in general, need the extra covariates in predFull to help
\item C3: predFull and predPars are best overall but predInt and chlPred are on par
\item D10: predInt and chlPred are best overall
\item D12: predInt best overall, on par with predPars, predFull, chlPred
\item D19: predFull is best overall, on par with predPars; predInt and chlPred are about the same order of magnitude
\item D22: chlPred does best, on par with predInt and predPars
\item D26: predPars does best, predFull gets bad in certain categories, predInt and chlPred are about the same order of magnitude, next up after predPars
\item D28A: chlPred is best, predPars, predFull, and predInt are next up and about the same order of magnitude
\item D4: predFull does best, predPars, predInt on par, chlPred not far behind
\item D6: predFull does best, predPars, predInt on par, chlPred not far behind
\item D7: predFull does best, predPars, predInt, chlPred next up
\item D8: predFull does best, predPars next predInt and chlPred a little bit behind
\item MD10: predFull does best, predPars and predInt next, chlPred decently behind
\item P8: chlPred does best, predPars and predFull next
