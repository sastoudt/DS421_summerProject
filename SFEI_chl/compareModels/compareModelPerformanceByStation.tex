\section{Observations by Station}

\begin{itemize}

\item C10: bad in general, need the extra covariates in predFull to help
\item C3: predFull and predPars are best overall but predInt and chlPred are on par
\item D10: predInt and chlPred are best overall
\item D12: predInt best overall, on par with predPars, predFull, chlPred
\item D19: predFull is best overall, on par with predPars; predInt and chlPred are about the same order of magnitude
\item D22: chlPred does best, on par with predInt and predPars
\item D26: predPars does best, predFull gets bad in certain categories, predInt and chlPred are about the same order of magnitude, next up after predPars
\item D28A: chlPred is best, predPars, predFull, and predInt are next up and about the same order of magnitude
\item D4: predFull does best, predPars, predInt on par, chlPred not far behind
\item D6: predFull does best, predPars, predInt on par, chlPred not far behind
\item D7: predFull does best, predPars, predInt, chlPred next up
\item D8: predFull does best, predPars next predInt and chlPred a little bit behind
\item MD10: predFull does best, predPars and predInt next, chlPred decently behind
\item P8: chlPred does best, predPars and predFull next

\section{Observations by Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item predPars: annual 4 and 5 most often minimum RMSE (7,4)
\item predFull: season 4, annual 5 and 6 most often minimum RMSE (4,3,3)
\item predInt: annual 6, annual 4, 5, seasonal 1 most often minimum RMSE (5, 3,3,3)
\item predSpat1: annual 4, annual 5, seasonal 1 most often minimum RMSE (4, 3,3)
\item predSpat2: annual 5 and seasonal 4 most often minimum RMSE (6, 3)
\item predSpat3: annual 5, annual 4 and 6 most often minimum RMSE (5, 3,3)
\item predSpat4: annual 5 most often minimum RMSE (6)
\item predSpat3Pheo: annual 5, 6 most often minimum RMSE (6, 3)
\item predSpat3Tn: annual 5, 6, 3 most often minimum RMSE (6, 3,3)
\item chlPred: annual 3, 5, 6 most often minimum RMSE (4, 3,3)
\item flowPred: annual 5, 6, 4 most often minimum RMSE (6, 5, 4)

\item annual 1: [1975, 1982)
\item annual 2: [1982, 1989)
\item annual 3: [1989, 1996)
\item annual 4: [1996, 2003)
\item annual 5: [2003, 2010)
\item annual 6: [2010, 2015] (less than the others)
\item seasonal 1: Jan, Feb, Mar
\item seasonal 2: Apr, May, Jun
\item seasonal 3: Jul, Aug, Sept
\item seasonal 4: Oct, Nov, Dec
\item after mid-90s better RMSE, we see this confirmed in the observations made from the shiny app
